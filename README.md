# Personal Website

Hello reader!

Welcome to my GitHub repository for my personal website. The website is currently a work-in-progress, but I would love to share with you a few updates and details. 

**Saturday, 27 March 2021**
- The design and prototype of my website is finished! Check out this [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/ZZJZYwNrC2lcnwXcgeEeIV/Personal-Website?node-id=2%3A187&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1) link to check it for yourself!
- Here's a small preview of the prototype:

  - I'm hoping to keep it as user-friendly as possible through minimizing dense text, utilizing icons, and keeping everything to a single page. 
  - When designing this prototype, I didn't have a long-scroll, single web page in mind (best to figure that out now in prototype rather than later!) so I included a `Click here to proceed to next page` section at the bottom of each page to mimic that.
  - With the exception of logos and icons from several institutions/programming languages/etc., the website follows a color palette generated from [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) and was checked through [WebAIM's Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to verify readability and accessibility for users. The distinct colors used includes:
    - #1875B6 (French Blue) - Background
    - #C33149 (French Raspberry) - Hyperlinked text
    - #688D77 (Wintegreen Dream) - Footer background, Good or working understanding
    - #FDE849 (Minion Yellow) - Knowledgeable, but could pick it up again quickly
    - #DE7C8D (Shimmering Blush) - It's been awhile, need time to refamiliarize myself
  - Checkout the color palette directly [here](https://coolors.co/1875b6-c33149-688d77-fde849-de7c8d)
  - On the first and second *Experience* pages, I'm unsure whether I'll include those programming languages/tools icons on side of each card, or embed them another way. 
  - On the third *Experience* page, I'm not sure whether I'll keep the card/bar underneath each programming language/tool/etc. I want to try laying out each of those icons on the web page without laying on top of something else. 
  - On the *Education* page, I'm thinking about changing the *Coursework* section to a *Sample Coursework* section to minimize that dense block of text. Maybe when I go to write this section, I'll have a "random" generation of four or five classes in their own bullet list each visit. 
- As I start to tackle writing the ***actual*** website, I'll be bouncing around the direction I want to take regarding frameworks/tools/etc. I may stick with using the Angular framework for now, but please don't be surprised if I revert back to some good ol' fashioned HTML/CSS/JavaScript instead or try out a different framework. Ultimately, I want to emphasize having fun for myself and learn along the way!

## Development server

To demo the project, run `ng serve --open` in your terminal and your browser will (hopefully) open `http://localhost:4200/` for you. 

If you've made it this far, please feel free to email me a message with "GITHUB README READ" as the subject and I will send you back an animal (or dinosaur) photo at random within 24 hours! If you want to choose between an animal or dinosaur, feel free to include that in your email message! Happy coding! ðŸ™‚
